Personal configuration for NeoVim. 
Current Version: 0.0.1

_Features to work on_
+ Better customization of key maps
  + current are default keymaps, and while they are functional, they are not something I would personally prefer
+ Starup screen
  + Having useful starup screen to quickly move between my projects from anywhere I go would be amazing experience.
  + It also comes to having access to quick search by files and by keyword
  + Having enlighting art work instead of default should be also a great addition to the start of my work :)
+ Better Icon pack
  + While default icon packs that come with the pre-configured set up I have are good enough, they are far from being what I trully want
+ Color theme edits
  + Currently I have both dark and light mode, but it would be awesome to customize the colors a bit for my taste (for example make the background slightly brighter)
