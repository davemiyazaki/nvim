# Personal configuration for NeoVim. <br>
`Version: 0.1.0`
---
### Current Features_ 
+ Has basic autocompletion
+ Has advanced LSP autocompletion
+ Has beautiful white and dark mode (changes depending on time)
+ Has directory tree system
+ Has search directory system
+ Has basic startup modifications (using mini.starter)
+ Has lualine
+ Has basic (pre-installed by dependencies) for lualine icon packs 

### Features to work on_
+ Better customization of key maps
  + _Current are default keymaps, and while they are functional, they are not something I would personally prefer_
+ Starup screen
  + _Having useful starup screen to quickly move between my projects from anywhere I go would be amazing experience._
  + _It also comes to having access to quick search by files and by keyword_
  + _Having enlighting art work instead of default should be also a great addition to the start of my work :)_
+ Better Icon pack
  + _While default icon packs that come with the pre-configured set up I have are good enough, they are far from being what I trully want_
+ Color theme edits
  + _Currently I have both dark and light mode, but it would be awesome to customize the colors a bit for my taste (for example make the background slightly brighter)_
